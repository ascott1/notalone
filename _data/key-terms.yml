- term: 'Title IX'
  definition: 'Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal law that protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities which receive Federal financial assistance. Title IX states that:"“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance". Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition protects against sexual harassment and sexual violence and extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity. Other examples of the types of discrimination that are covered under Title IX include the failure to provide equal opportunity in athletics; discrimination in a school’s science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses and programs; and discrimination based on pregnancy and parental status. OCR is a primary authority for investigating alleged violations of Title IX in educational institutions because the U.S. Department of Education gives financial assistance to virtually all educational institutions in the country. Other agencies, such as DOJ, that give federal grants or assistance to an educational institution, share authority for addressing alleged violations of Title IX in educational institutions. If a school that receives the Department’s federal funds is found to have violated Title IX and does not come into compliance voluntarily, OCR may initiate proceedings to withdraw federal funding granted by the Department or refer the case to DOJ for litigation.'

- term: 'Title IX Coordinator'
  definition: 'Educational institutions that receive federal funding must designate at least one employee to coordinate the recipient’s compliance with Title IX. This person is often called a “Title IX coordinator.” The coordinator’s responsibilities include overseeing all Title IX complaints and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints. The Title IX coordinators should not have other job responsibilities that may create a conflict of interest, and they must have adequate training on what constitutes sexual harassment and university procedures.'

- term: 'Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964'

- term: 'U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR)'
  definition: 'The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within the U.S. Department of Education is charged with ensuring equal access to education and promoting educational excellence throughout the nation through vigorous enforcement of civil rights. OCR serves student populations facing discrimination and the advocates and institutions promoting systemic solutions to civil rights problems. In educational settings that receive federal funds, OCR enforces federal laws that prohibit discrimination on the bases of race, color, and national origin under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; discrimination on the basis of disability discrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; discrimination on the basis of age under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975; and the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act. OCR addresses sexual violence on college campuses through Title IX enforcement. OCR’s enforcement activities are conducted by its 12 enforcement offices throughout the country. Persons or organizations that believe an education institution that receives federal financial assistance has discriminated against them may file a complaint with OCR. The person or organization filing the complaint need not be a victim of the alleged discrimination, but may complain on behalf of another person or group. OCR is charged with investigating and responding to complaints as well as conducting proactive compliance reviews. OCR also issues policy guidance regarding the laws it enforces and provides technical assistance to help institutions achieve voluntary compliance with the civil rights laws that OCR enforces. There are similar offices, sometimes with similar names, throughout the federal government. Under Title IX, every federal agency that disburses federal grants or other federal assistance must have an office that is responsible for enforcing compliance with Title IX.'

- term: 'U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division (CRT)'

Specifically, the Division, through its Educational Opportunities Section, directly enforces Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), and Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Section also can enforce other statutes such as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Section may intervene in private suits alleging violations of education-related anti-discrimination statutes and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Section also represents the U.S. Department of Education in lawsuits. The Division is responsible for coordinating enforcement of Title IX across federal agencies and can enforce Title IX through complaint investigations, compliance reviews, litigation, intervention in Title IX court cases brought by private persons, and the filing of amicus briefs or statements of interest in Title IX court cases.  The Division can also resolve complaints of sex-based discrimination in public schools, colleges, and universities through investigations, litigation, voluntary settlement agreements, and consent decrees under Title IV.'
  
- term: 'U.S. Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women (OVW)'

OVW implements the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and subsequent legislation and provides national leadership on issues of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. Since its inception, OVW has supported a multifaceted approach to responding to these crimes through implementation of formula and discretionary grant programs authorized by VAWA.

  definition: 'The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 amended the Violence Against Women Act and the Clery Act to provide new requirements for schools to prevent and respond to sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. Some of these requirements include providing primary prevention education and awareness programs for all incoming students and employees; collecting statistics on domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking in addition to current requirements to collect sexual assault statistics; issuing complainants a written notice of their rights; and adopting grievance policies that are prompt, fair, and impartial as well as administered by trained officials. These updates are sometimes referred to as Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act or Campus SaVE Act.'

- term: 'Voluntary Resolution Agreement'
  definition: 'An agreement voluntarily reached between the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and an educational institution that resolves alleged civil rights violations that OCR investigates, either before OCR has finished its investigation or after OCR has investigated and found that the institution failed to comply with the law. OCR is required by law to attempt to secure voluntary compliance with the laws it enforces, including Title IX, prior to pursuing other enforcement options against institutions. Congress established this voluntary resolution scheme specifically to ensure that schools and districts would have the opportunity, when necessary, to come into compliance quickly while also providing for ultimate enforcement where an institution resists compliance. Even though the educational institution’s decision to enter into the resolution agreement is voluntary, compliance with the resolution agreement is mandatory once it is agreed to. OCR closely monitors the institution’s implementation of the resolution agreement to ensure that the commitments made are implemented in a timely and effective manner. OCR may conduct on-site visits as part of its monitoring. OCR may also conduct individual interviews and focus groups as part of the on-site monitoring activities.'
