## Organizations and Services

Many other websites provide information about campus sexual assault – what it is, how to get help, how to prevent assault, and ways to take action. We do not endorse any particular website, but want you to have access to lots of different resources.

### LGBTQ Resources
Many survivors identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). Unfortunately, the LGBT community experiences sexual violence at high rates. One study found that 13.2% of bisexual men and 11.6% of gay men were raped in adulthood, compared to 1.6% of heterosexual men. [i](#i){: .cite} According to the CDC, 46% of bisexual women have been raped, compared to 13% of lesbians and 7% of heterosexual women. [ii](#ii){: .cite} Another study found that more than 25% of transgender individuals had been sexually assaulted after the age of 13.

While numbers are difficult to estimate, immigrants and international students face unique difficulties. Perpetrators may threaten to have their victims deported if they try to seek help, making immigrant survivors less likely to report these crimes. Immigrant and international student survivors may also be unaware or confused by the services that are available, particularly if service providers lack linguistically or culturally appropriate resources. The below resources provide linguistically and culturally appropriate resources for international and immigrant survivors:
