The U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is posting nearly all recent resolution letters and agreements with schools on its [website](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/search-ocr.html).  OCR will also make public the schools that are under OCR investigation, including those that involve Title IX sexual violence allegations.  To ensure that the most up-to-date information is provided, interested parties should contact [OCR headquarters](malito:ocr@ed.gov) or the [closest regional office](https://wdcrobcolp01.ed.gov/CFAPPS/OCR/contactus.cfm).
